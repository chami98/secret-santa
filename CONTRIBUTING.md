# Contributing to Secret Santa App

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Follow the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) guide to set up your local environment
2. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Enable strict mode
- Define proper interfaces/types
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components focused and small

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: PascalCase for components (`SignInPage.tsx`), camelCase for utilities (`validation.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`CreateEventDialog`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`createEvent`, `sendEmail`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_KEY`, `MAX_PARTICIPANTS`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with descriptive names (`Event`, `Participant`)

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Be open to suggestions
- Update based on reviews

### For Reviewers

- Be constructive and respectful
- Test the changes if possible
- Check for edge cases
- Verify documentation updates

## Architecture Decisions

### When to Use...

**Context vs Props**
- Use Context for: Auth state, theme, global settings
- Use Props for: Component-specific data, callbacks

**Service vs Component Logic**
- Services: API calls, data transformation
- Components: UI logic, user interactions

**Cloud Functions vs Client**
- Functions: Sensitive operations, email sending, complex algorithms
- Client: UI interactions, data display, form validation

## Security Considerations

When contributing, consider:

- [ ] No sensitive data in client code
- [ ] Proper authentication checks
- [ ] Firestore security rules updated
- [ ] Input validation on both client and server
- [ ] Email addresses validated
- [ ] No exposure of assignment data

## Performance Guidelines

- Minimize Firestore reads/writes
- Use batched writes when possible
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize images and assets
- Lazy load routes if needed

## Documentation

When adding features, update:

- [ ] README.md (if user-facing)
- [ ] SETUP.md (if setup changes)
- [ ] Code comments (for complex logic)
- [ ] Type definitions (for new data structures)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Functions won't deploy

**Solution:**
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
# Check for TypeScript errors
```

### Issue: Firestore rules fail

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test rules locally
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

### Issue: Email not sending

**Solution:**
- Check SendGrid API key
- Verify sender email
- Check function logs

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check README.md and SETUP.md
- **Issues**: Search existing issues or create new one
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions

## Feature Requests

To request a feature:

1. Check if it already exists in issues
2. Create new issue with "Feature Request" label
3. Describe the feature and use case
4. Include mockups if applicable

## Bug Reports

To report a bug:

1. Check if it's already reported
2. Create new issue with "Bug" label
3. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce
